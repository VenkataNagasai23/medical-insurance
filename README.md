# medical-insurance
This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict insurance costs based on patient health data.
# Overview
The insurance.py script demonstrates the following:

Loading the dataset from a CSV file (insurance.csv).
Preprocessing the dataset by encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder and normalizing numerical features.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression.
Evaluating the performance of each model using R-squared score and F1 score.
# Requirements

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib
# Best Accuracy
Linear Regression: 78%
Decision Tree Regression: 85%
Random Forest Regression: 87%
XGBoost Regression: 88%
